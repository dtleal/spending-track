# Contributing to SpendTrack

Thank you for your interest in contributing to SpendTrack! This document outlines the development workflow and guidelines for contributing to this project.

## üöÄ Development Workflow

### Branch Structure

- **`main`** - Production branch (protected)
  - Contains stable, production-ready code
  - Only accessible via Pull Requests from `dev`
  - Requires code review and approval

- **`dev`** - Development branch (default)
  - Main development branch
  - All feature branches merge here first
  - Integration testing happens here

- **`feature/*`** - Feature branches
  - Created from `dev` for new features
  - Naming convention: `feature/feature-name`
  - Merged back to `dev` via Pull Request

- **`bugfix/*`** - Bug fix branches
  - Created from `dev` for bug fixes
  - Naming convention: `bugfix/issue-description`
  - Merged back to `dev` via Pull Request

- **`hotfix/*`** - Emergency fixes
  - Created from `main` for critical production fixes
  - Naming convention: `hotfix/issue-description`
  - Merged to both `main` and `dev`

## üîÑ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone git@github.com:dtleal/spending-track.git
cd spending-track
```

### 2. Set Up Development Environment
```bash
# Copy environment files
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
cp frontend/.env.local.example frontend/.env.local  # if exists

# Edit the .env files with your local configuration
# Add your API keys, database credentials, etc.

# Start the development environment
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d
```

### 3. Verify Setup
- Frontend: http://localhost:3000
- Backend API: http://localhost:8000
- API Docs: http://localhost:8000/docs

## üìù Development Process

### For New Features

1. **Create Feature Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout dev
   git pull origin dev
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Develop Your Feature**
   ```bash
   # Make your changes
   # Write tests
   # Update documentation if needed
   ```

3. **Test Your Changes**
   ```bash
   # Run backend tests
   cd backend && python -m pytest

   # Run frontend tests (if available)
   cd frontend && npm test

   # Test the application manually
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d
   ```

4. **Commit Your Changes**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add: description of your feature
   
   - Detailed explanation of what was added
   - Any breaking changes
   - Related issue number if applicable

   ```

5. **Push and Create Pull Request**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```
   Then create a Pull Request from `feature/your-feature-name` ‚Üí `dev`

### For Bug Fixes

1. **Create Bug Fix Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout dev
   git pull origin dev
   git checkout -b bugfix/issue-description
   ```

2. **Follow the same process as features**

### For Hotfixes (Emergency Production Fixes)

1. **Create Hotfix Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git checkout -b hotfix/critical-issue
   ```

2. **Fix and Test**
   ```bash
   # Make minimal changes to fix the issue
   # Test thoroughly
   ```

3. **Create Pull Requests**
   ```bash
   git push origin hotfix/critical-issue
   ```
   Create PRs: `hotfix/critical-issue` ‚Üí `main` AND `hotfix/critical-issue` ‚Üí `dev`
